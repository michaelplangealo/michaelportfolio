                Hi there. I'm Michael Plange, a Front-End Web Developer based
                out of Dallas, Texas. <Peekaboo>yeehaw</Peekaboo>
              </AboutIntro>
              <AboutContent>
                I graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2014
                with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology. I did research there
                as well, over a large array of topics, mostly in emotions and
                behavior as well as the effects of pharmaceutical medicine. Lab
                rats and unwilling research participants were my best friends,
                but in the meantime I fostered my love for anything and
                everything creative. While I was wrapping up my undergrad, I had
                the choice of pursuing either my Masters or PhD, or applying for
                Pharamcy School. It was then I realized that I probably
                shouldn't do either of those things (the last thing the world
                needs is a bad therapist or a bad pharamcist) and decided to
                turn my attention elsewhere. I felt that the best field for me
                to work in would be a field in which I could explore creative
                possibilities while solving a problem, imbued with my own
                personality. After a bit of much needed soul-searching, I found
                myself in the field of Web Development, scratching my itch of
                being both creative and practical.
